DbContext
An abstract base class that defines the overall structure and database context for the application. It serves as a blueprint for interacting with the underlying database.

InSyncContext
The main database context class, inheriting from DbContext. It defines DbSet properties for all entities in the system, such as Assets, Projects, Users, and others, to facilitate CRUD operations.

IRepositoryBase<T>
An interface defining the generic base repository operations, including methods for adding, updating, deleting, retrieving a single entity by condition, and retrieving all entities.

RepositoryBase<T>
A base implementation of IRepositoryBase<T> that provides shared logic for repository operations. It uses InSyncContext for database interactions and includes resource management to handle disposal.

IAssetRepository
An interface for repository operations specific to the Asset entity. Inherits generic operations from IRepositoryBase<Asset>.

AssetRepository
A repository implementation for managing Asset entities. Inherits shared behavior from RepositoryBase<Asset> and interacts with the InSyncContext.

ICategoryDocumentRepository
An interface for repository operations specific to the CategoryDocument entity. Includes a method for deleting a category document by its ID, in addition to generic operations.

CategoryDocumentRepository
A repository implementation for managing CategoryDocument entities. Inherits from RepositoryBase<CategoryDocument> and implements logic to delete a category document by ID.

ICustomerReviewRepository
An interface for repository operations specific to the CustomerReview entity. Inherits basic CRUD operations from IRepositoryBase<CustomerReview>.

CustomerReviewRepository
A repository implementation for managing CustomerReview entities. Extends RepositoryBase<CustomerReview> to interact with the InSyncContext.

IDocumentRepository
An interface for repository operations specific to the Document entity. Inherits basic repository functionality from IRepositoryBase<Document>.

DocumentRepository
A repository implementation for managing Document entities. Provides CRUD operations by extending RepositoryBase<Document> and interacting with the InSyncContext.

IPageRepository
An interface for repository operations specific to the Page entity. Inherits generic CRUD operations from IRepositoryBase<Page>.

PageRepository
A repository implementation for managing Page entities. Inherits from RepositoryBase<Page> and uses the InSyncContext for database interactions.

IProjectRepository
An interface for repository operations specific to the Project entity. Includes a method to delete a project by its ID in addition to the generic repository operations.

ProjectRepository
A repository implementation for managing Project entities. Extends RepositoryBase<Project> and provides logic to delete a project by ID. It uses the InSyncContext for database interactions.

IScenarioRepository
An interface for repository operations specific to the Scenario entity. Inherits the basic CRUD operations from IRepositoryBase<Scenario>.

ScenarioRepository
A repository implementation for managing Scenario entities. Extends RepositoryBase<Scenario> to interact with the InSyncContext.

ISubscriptionPlanRepository
An interface for repository operations specific to the SubscriptionPlan entity. Includes a method to delete a subscription plan by its ID in addition to generic repository functionality.

SubscriptionPlanRepository
A repository implementation for managing SubscriptionPlan entities. Inherits from RepositoryBase<SubscriptionPlan> and provides logic to delete a subscription plan by ID.

IUserRepository
An interface for repository operations specific to the User entity. Inherits CRUD operations from IRepositoryBase<User>.

UserRepository
A repository implementation for managing User entities. Extends RepositoryBase<User> to interact with the InSyncContext.

IUserSubscriptionRepository
An interface for repository operations specific to the UserSubscription entity. Inherits basic CRUD operations from IRepositoryBase<UserSubscription>.

UserSubscriptionRepository
A repository implementation for managing UserSubscription entities. Extends RepositoryBase<UserSubscription> and interacts with the InSyncContext.
